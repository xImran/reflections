How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it easier to find out the typo error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would make it easier to find mistakes and revert back to older versions in-case of error in the new program.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manual control is much better.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Since we work with multiple files when doing development so Git is much superior.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log will show all the commits with their messages and id, will diff allows to compare files, commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes it much easier to trace and track the changes to revert back in case of error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Want to put all my code on Git so the development work is easier and faster
